Hi!

Are you ready to pretend like you're on chopped while making tonight's recipe?

Let's get started.

To use this API, there are a few dependencies you will need installed. Make sure you have imported the following:

sys <-- this allows us the function to use the ingredients you type into the command line
config <-- this allows us to keep our API key in a separate file
requests <-- this allows us to facilitate a GET request
json <-- this allows us to manipulate the information we get from the API

Clone this repository if you have not already.

Next, you will need your very own API key. If there weren't limits, there's a chance I'd share mine ;)
Head over to https://spoonacular.com/food-api and create an account for FR-FR-FREE.

Once you have your API Key, go ahead and update the config.py file accordingly. 
Save the file.

Almost time for our chef hats. 

CD into the cloned repository. 
Next, run to your kitchen (yes. sprint) and check to see what ingredients you have to make a meal.
Open the terminal, and enter the ingredients in the manner shown below. In my example I have cheese, lettuce, and tomatoes

"python recipefinder.py cheese, lettuce, tomatoes"

Happy eating!

If you are looking to test the API, I highly recommend Postman as that is what I used for this project.
